# 🧼 Customer Personality Analysis - Data Cleaning

Welcome! This project focuses on **cleaning and preprocessing** raw customer marketing data to prepare it for effective analysis. The dataset was sourced from a marketing campaign and includes customer demographics, purchase behavior, and spending patterns.

## 📌 Objective
As part of a Data Analyst Internship, the goal was to:
- Handle missing values
- Remove duplicates
- Standardize column names and formats
- Convert data types and fix inconsistencies
- Export a clean, analysis-ready dataset

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Files Included
- `Customer_Personality_Analysis.ipynb` – Main notebook with all data cleaning steps
- `marketing_campaign.csv` – Original raw dataset
- `customer_personality_cleaned.csv` – Final cleaned dataset
- `task 1.pdf` – Task instructions

## ✅ Key Tasks Performed
- Checked and handled null values with `.isnull()` and `.fillna()`
- Removed duplicate records using `.drop_duplicates()`
- Standardized date formats and text data (e.g., `Dt_Customer`, gender, education)
- Cleaned and renamed columns for readability
- Verified and corrected data types

## 🔍 Sample Insights (Post-Cleaning)
- Customers aged 25–50 form the core target group
- Higher income correlates with higher wine spending
- Loyalty duration helps understand high-value customers

## 📊 Next Steps
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Customer Segmentation
- Predictive modeling
